# Monitoring Assessment

This is a Data Analysis for a QBR session with the merchant PPA. This consists of a presentation to their management team containing the most relevant insights of the period. The data for it has already been extracted. The presentation includes analysis for performance insights, using the data TEST_CS.xlsx

## Considerations
· These are live transactions from Argentina from March / April / May 2021.\
· Conversion rate: the #1 metric to measure how our platform is performing for a particular
merchant. We calculate this as Conversion Rate = (Count of Paid transactions) / (Count of All transactions)\
· Payment Method Code: These are identifiers for each payment method the end users use. In this case, you will see the following:
```      o AE (American Express Credit Card)
      o AG (Argencard Credit Cards)
      o CB (Cordobesa Credit Cards)
      o CL (Cabal Credit Cards)
      o CM (CMR Credit Cards)
      o CO (Cordial Credit Cards)
      o DC (Diners Credit Cards)
      o DI (Discover Credit Cards)
      o EL (Elo Credit Cards)
      o JC (JCB Credit Cards)
      o LD (Cabal Debit Cards)
      o MC (Master Credit Cards)
      o MD (Master Debit Cards)
      o MS (Maestro Debit Cards)
      o NJ (Naranja Credit Cards)
      o NT (Nativa Credit Cards)
      o VI (Visa Credit Cards)
      o VD (Visa Debit Cards)
```
· Card Issuer: Bank or entity that issued a card to a shopper to make cashless payments via an
e-commerce website, inside a mobile app, or in a physical store.\
· Installment: Sum of money due as one of several equal payments for something, spread over
an agreed period.

## Some questions we answer with the analysis
· What is the overall conversion rate in Argentina?\
· What is the conversion per payment method?\
· Which is the most relevant payment method?\
· Is there a specific payment method that has presented a particular issue in one of the
months that you think would be relevant to highlight?\
· On which date (Transaction Creation Date) were there the most paid transactions?\
· What is the average ticket price?
```
     o Is there any difference between Rejected and Paid transactions?
     o Is there a particular pattern between the Payment Method Type and ticket price?
```
· What Payment Method Code is the one with the highest average ticket price? Why do
you think that is?\
· Is there any particular issue with any user that might be affecting the overall Conversion
Rate?\
· Which is the most relevant issuer?\
· Can we identify any patterns with installments that the merchant should be aware of?
